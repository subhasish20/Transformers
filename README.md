## Installation 🛠️

To get started, you'll need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhasish20/Transformers.git
cd transformers
```

### Install Dependencies:

For Python, use `pip` to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage 🖥️

### Running the Transformer Model:

Once installed, you can use the transformer model for your own tasks. Here's an example:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Create a pipeline for sentiment analysis
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Analyze a sample text
result = classifier("I love this repository! It's awesome! 😄")
print(result)
```

### Available Pipelines:

* Sentiment Analysis 🧠
* Text Generation ✍️
* Translation 🌐
* Question Answering ❓
* Named Entity Recognition 🏷️

## Models 🏋️‍♂️

This repository includes pre-trained transformer models such as:

* **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 🔥
* **GPT-3** (Generative Pretrained Transformer) ✨
* **T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) 🧑‍💻

These models are fine-tuned for various tasks and can be easily adapted to new tasks.
